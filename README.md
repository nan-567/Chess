Step 1: Accomplished the step by creating separate Classes Chess and BoardComponent. In BoardComponent I created a for loop to draw the squares on the board. I also created colors in BoardComponent.
Step 2: Accomplished this step by creating paintcomponent() in BoardComponent.
step 3: Accomplished this step by creating 8X8 array in class and named it position[][]. This is also where I created the code to put the images of the pieces on my board. I also created drawpiece()and created a for loop to iterate through our array and draw pieces in the valid positions on the board. 
step 4: Accomplished by creating a BoardMouseListener Class and created mousepressed and mouserelease, so this will allow the user to move the black and white pieces in the board.
step 5: Accomplished by creating if statements that would allow the user to only move the white pieces on the board and prevent them from moving the black pieces assigned to the computer. 
step 6: Created computer player and math.random will help generate random moves from the computer player when I make a move. At the same time I move the white pieces, the computer will move the black pieces only.
